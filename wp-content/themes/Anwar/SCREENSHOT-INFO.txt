SCREENSHOT REQUIREMENTS FOR ANWAR THEME
==========================================

To complete the theme installation, you need to add a screenshot.png file to the theme root directory.

SPECIFICATIONS:
- Filename: screenshot.png
- Dimensions: 1200 x 900 pixels (4:3 ratio)
- Format: PNG
- Location: wp-content/themes/Anwar/screenshot.png

WHAT TO INCLUDE:
Capture the homepage of your theme showing:
- Hero section with your branding
- Navigation menu
- Key sections (services preview, portfolio, etc.)
- Footer

HOW TO CREATE:
1. Install and activate the theme
2. Configure the homepage with sample content
3. Take a screenshot at 1200x900 pixels
4. Save as screenshot.png in the theme root folder

ALTERNATIVE:
You can use a design mockup or theme preview image that showcases the theme's design and features.

TOOLS TO CREATE SCREENSHOT:
- Browser DevTools (set viewport to 1200x900)
- Screenshot tools (Lightshot, Snagit, etc.)
- Image editors (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma)

NOTE:
The theme will work without a screenshot, but adding one makes it look more professional in the WordPress theme selector.

For now, you can use a placeholder or create a simple branded image with:
- Theme name: "Anwar"
- Tagline: "Professional WordPress Portfolio Theme"
- Your logo or brand colors
- Simple graphic elements
